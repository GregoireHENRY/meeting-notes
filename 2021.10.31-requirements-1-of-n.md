# Requirement meeting 1

**Date:** 2021 OCT 31

**Attendees**:
+ Greg H (gregh)
+ Chris R (xionbox)

## Action items for next meeting
1. *Everyone:*
    1. Populate the requirements list as per the process defined below. File is on Google Spreadsheets, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVdIzFxZY0913l-lUsC27rRMNqeEny84SRQW13_eLAc/edit?usp=sharing).
    1. Populate the slides for the LSIC meeting. Keep it short, only 10 minutes and plus 5 of Q&A. File is on Google Slides, [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jBwyICK-q_-mE8QRYiz5oZkvn6oLxyX4sSYv3NnMhM/edit?usp=sharing).
1. Greg:
    1. Start working on the Rust project with the `specs` repo as a submodule
    1. Investigate whether Flatbuffers could be used to write tests, or if another framework can be used to write generic tests in several languages to avoid cloning the test suite for each supported language
1. Chris R:
    1. Write meeting notes and requirement process
    1. Create Google documents for requirements and for LSIC 18 Nov 2021 meeting
    1. Send next meeting invite
    1. Send LSIC meeting invite, and ask Sarah Whitee for Greg and Chris DC to join too
    1. Check that Greg can create a project on nyx-space/anise gitlab group

## Action items of previous meeting
- [x] *Everyone:*

    - [ ] Share `flatc` command to generate Rust bindings -- _Greg and Chris actually had the same command_


# Agenda
## First few thoughts on requirements
These are Greg's requirements with a summary of the conversation that followed.

- Test driven development should be done before any code, including specs
- A common compilation and build script to ensure reproducibility of builds
- Can test suite be generated for all languages at once to avoid cloning the test suite -- best would be if that could be done in the FBS format
- Fuzzy testing (possibly formal verification) should be added where possible
- Shape model work should be a big module, and should include GPU based computations for shadow mapping, etc.
    - Greg has lots of experience on this, so he could be responsible for this part of the requirements.
- Time management, frame computations, light-time corrections, etc. shall be supported
    - Chris has lots of experience with this when working on XBs, so he can tackle that.
- Basic satellite operations, like event management, servo control, and the like could be useful too
    - Chris thinks that each spacecraft is too specific to have a common framework for most operations.
    - At the same time, if this isn't supported, what's the point of having the libraries be flight software ready?
    - Maybe a middle ground can be found where a subset of functions can be FSW-ready and plug-and-playable (as Juno mentioned last time), including quaternion math and frame transformations
- It should be possible to incorporate MPC and HORIZON-generated ephemerides
- Some basic functions like visibility analysis for inter-satellite links and eclipses should be provided
- All rotations and translations should be provided only as interpolation data, no "exact" state/quaternion or equations defining this information. For example, SPICE allows defining a low precision rotation with time variying equations of right ascension, declination, and twist angles. This is problematic for on-board computation because it needs to be interpreted each time. Instead, ANISE should provide a command line tool to generate a kernel for that rotation (which would be a set of interpolation splines for each component of the quaternion), and that kernel can be merged into another kernel pool. The downside of this approach is the need for the tool, and maybe even for a domain-specific language to define these rotations, but overall it'll make operations smoother.
