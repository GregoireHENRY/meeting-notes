# Agenda
Round robin order: Greg, Chris DC, Juno, Chris R

## Experience using SPICE
### Greg
+ Current team used SPICE for HERA mission analysis, especially the frame transformations and ephemeris features.
+ SPICE is hard to get into and learn, especially writing new kernels. Subkernels would be a helpful feature.
+ Reading DSK properties from kernel pool is especially difficult, which made my work on ray tracing quite difficult. Moreover, SPICE does not provide any GPU interface, so ray tracing computation takes a very long time.

### Chris DC
+ Experience is limited so far, mostly got an intro via Greg
+ Seems like there are thousands of disorganized tutorials. Lots of things aren't used, like even kernels.
+ No central exchange to find the raw data of the kernels
+ Writing kernels can be simplified through the tools NAIF provides
+ Any GPU interface should be opt-in to ensure FSW-readiness
+ It's quite hard to find specific info like event kernels.

### Juno
+ Nice to have multiple kernels to compare, but SPICE does not allow you to duplicate a kernel pool
+ Object Oriented Programmaing of SPICE would be extremely usable
+ Duplicating kernels is possible but not open-source nor documented
+ Weird unit system, like instrument location is in kilometers
+ Clock kernels are inaccessible. Code is unmaintainable (FORTRAN to C is not human readable). Cannot use in FSW because you need to include everything.
+ A central data exchange would be very useful, especially if it's searchable.

### Chris R
+ Lack of covariance information in states, attitude, and body rate is a real pity. OEM provides that, but it has a ton of limitations making it incredibly impractical in FSW.
+ The data format (FORTRAN memory dump) makes SPICE data basically unusable if you aren't using the official libraries as a backend.
+ Searching for a specific kernel is quite complicated, mostly need to be lucky with Google. 
+ Spacecraft clock kernels (SCLK) are required for storing attitude data (CK kernels), but the documentation for SCLK kernels specifies that their models are obsolete.
+ Single threaded application prevents any error handling.

## In a perfect world, what would SPICE be able to do?
### Greg
+ Computation on CPU or GPU as an option
+ Most of the time we use SPICE, it's to graph stuff, so why not include that?
+ A Cargo-like share exchange of data
+ Lots of functions need kernel info and cannot require any external data: that complicates tools greatly.

### Chris DC
+ Orbit propagation with perturbation models

### Juno
+ Covariances would be good
+ FSW that can be plug and play
+ Support for LVLH / RNC or other spacecraft local frames
+ Custom topographical frame on a continental plate

### Chris R
+ FSW-ready: zero memory allocations, some (most?) code being formally verified, no panics ever, even on indexing errors. Work should follow a test driven development approach.
+ Covariance support
+ Interfaces to easily build the files in real time. This could be used as an onboard storage of navigation filters, downlinked to the ground, and plugged into the same tools that people use on the ground.
+ External data, at the very least for reference frame transformation (instead of using spkezr and pxform and then manually rotate and translate a vector)

## Who would be the target audiance of ANISE and how do we gather feedback from them?
Unanimity: people like us who need to use precise ephemeris and attitude data.

We should build the LSIC presentation together. Presentation currently scheduled 18 November 2021.

Greg also has contacts in the NAIF team. We'd need to figure out how to best approach them without alienating them of course. SPICE is a great piece of work, we'd just like to provide a modern update. Same diplomacy should be used with observatory engineers. SPICE2 has DSK updates planned, but updates have been limited. Note that there currently is a Spiceypy pull request that adds multithreading via ThreadPool.
